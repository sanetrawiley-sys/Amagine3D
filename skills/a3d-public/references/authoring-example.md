# Public BRep authoring examples

Choose the example that demonstrates the API structure you need:

- `simple_brep_intent.py` and `simple_brep_build.py`: one rounded body with a
  blind pocket, showing `BuildSession.add`, `finish`, `cut` and `export`.
- `assembly_intent.py` and `assembly_build.py`: a removable pin and blind socket
  coupon, showing two manufactured parts and a locating fit.
- `surface_shell_intent.py` and `surface_shell_build.py`: an outer BRep loft and
  an inner loft cutter, showing a section-controlled shell.
- `installed_module_intent.py` and `installed_module_build.py`: a configurable
  front-facing (−Y), rear-service (+Y) module installation, with world Z up,
  a real window, support, access, optional preview reference and installation
  evidence against final manufactured parts.

These are API examples. Develop the actual shape, dimensions, features and part
boundaries from the user's request. `BuildSession` binds the authored BRep solids
through the existing `write_scene` and STEP exporters. `surface-shell.md` explains
the loft example's controls and wall-thickness checks.

Run in the current session workspace (the runtime supplies `AMAGINE3D_SKILL_DIR` and `AMAGINE3D_RUNTIME_DIR`).
For a new ordinary single part, copy and draft `simple_brep_build.py` without an
intent or profile:

```bash
cp "$AMAGINE3D_SKILL_DIR/examples/simple_brep_build.py" ./model_build.py
```

```bash
a3d draft model_build.py
```

Use `installed_module_draft.py` before the contract only when a purchased
component's envelope, placement or insertion layout must appear in the first
preview. Read the full `installed_module_build.py` later, after the design is
confirmed to require installation, support, closure, maintenance or fastening
evidence.

Inspect the returned preview with `view_image`, then develop the geometry in this
source. The installed-module source owns its construction controls; its intent
generator imports them without running geometry and keeps the brief's overall and
component dimensions independent. No parameter JSON is needed. The draft's
`constructionFeatures` lists registered IDs, owners and roles to reuse when
writing intent; it is not the requirements or a complete list of operations.

The `assembly` and `surface_shell` examples read intent parameters, so create and
validate their intent before their first draft. Other intent-bound sources have
the same requirement. Draft export is isolated under `.amagine3d-drafts`; it
carries no final acceptance. Keep the same geometry source for final compile. A
source without intent can declare `BuildSession(__file__, part_names=("housing",
"cover"))` and use `build.add("cover-body", solid, part_name="cover")` (also on
`cut`/`observe`). With intent, declared IDs bind features to their owners. Extra
`add`/`cut` IDs with explicit `part_name` record checked construction operations
only; `observe` requires a declared ID. Final export still requires every intent
feature. Pass optional preview component envelopes as
`build.export(draft_references={"module": solid})`; they do not become
manufactured parts or final installation evidence.

After exploration, create and validate the matching final intent and selected
printer profile. The profile below is an illustrative fallback; use the selected
machine/nozzle or an existing valid profile:

```bash
a3d profile --nozzle 0.4 --tool 0 --out model_printer-profile.json
```

```bash
cp "$AMAGINE3D_SKILL_DIR/examples/simple_brep_intent.py" ./model_intent.py
```

```bash
python3 model_intent.py
```

```bash
a3d intent model_intent.json
```

```bash
a3d compile model_scene.json --intent model_intent.json --source model_build.py --output-dir .
```

The intent source writes the target separately. The compiler executes the build
with the bound intent, scene and output paths in environment variables. The build
constructs physical objects; its session derives feature evidence and scene nodes
from those objects, then exports. Inspect the current final preview with `view_image`.

## Reuse one feature identity

Declare feature IDs once in intent. `BuildSession` obtains their physical owners
from that contract; `add` and `cut` use each ID once for geometry, scene and evidence:

```python
from build123d import Box
from build_session import BuildSession

build = BuildSession(__file__)
build.add("housing-body", Box(30, 20, 5))
build.cut("service-slot", Box(8, 4, 8))
build.export()
```

For a final fillet, use `build.finish("housing", lambda body:
checked_fillet(body, body.edges(), RADIUS, "edge-rounding"))`. `finish` commits
the returned solid and checked evidence; a declared fillet/chamfer ID also binds
that intent feature. Implementation-only operation IDs need no
additional intent feature. In either case,
selectors must come from the callback's body. `build.part("housing")` returns a
copy for inspection, so changing that copy alone does not change exported geometry.

`observe(id, shape)` binds a physical observation without a material operation;
omitting shape observes the current owning part. Naming a whole-part observation
"floor" does not measure floor thickness. Use `role="solid"` to identify a solid
feature already contained in the part, such as a screw boss within a thick corner.
For several additions implementing one declared `kind: mount`, add the pieces with
internal operation IDs, then bind the actual mounting material once:

```python
pieces = [("bottom-rail", bottom), ("left-guide", left), ("right-guide", right)]
for operation_id, piece in pieces:
    build.add(operation_id, piece, part_name="frame")
build.observe("module-mount", bottom + left + right, role="solid", part_name="frame")
```

Here `bottom`, `left` and `right` are the actual modeled support solids. Fuse their
material union for a watertight observation; a Compound of touching solids can
retain non-manifold contact faces. This mount observation is not a cavity or an
installation proof. Keep the original cavity cuts, component envelopes, paths,
installation checks and independent hole/interface bindings. Reuse the declared
mount ID for its same-owner display anchor.

A missed cut still fails, and final
geometry, interface and installation checks remain independent. Paired interfaces,
raw screw interfaces and installation checks pass through `export`. The screw
pair's `bind` applies its three shapes at one location and returns the fastener
record; choose `boss_mode="add"` for new material or `"observe"` for an existing
receiver. See the installed-module example; final geometry audits still apply.

The installed-module example uses a local `interval_box` with explicit lower/upper
bounds for each axis; a lower-bound datum cannot also be used as a centered Box's
position. Reuse the module and window intervals for cavities and installation
paths so geometry and its witnesses share the same datums.
Its locator derives from those cavity intervals and its screws from a shared
outer-corner margin. The female cutter must intersect real receiving material;
for a thin-wall enclosure, design a receiving step that retains the required
minimum wall instead of copying the thick frame's dimensions.

For explicit bindings or regional color exports, the existing `BrepFeature`,
`write_scene` and exporters remain available. Use `with build.capture():` if
additional existing helper parameters or observations need the session's evidence.

## Stable targets and explicit revisions

Repair source geometry and scene bindings against the existing intent. A new
filename alone does not establish a changed target. Intent records final targets
and acceptance, while build source owns implementation parameters such as section
count, cutter overshoot and loft mode. An inset may change to meet an unchanged
minimum wall requirement; a user-requested dimension or form must remain satisfied.
For an allowed target parameter
adjustment, record the range in the initial intent, before adjusting that target,
in `dimensions_mm`, for example:

```python
dimensions_mm["x"] = {
    "value": 40, "source": "inferred", "confidence": "medium",
    "constraint": {"kind": "range", "min_mm": 38, "max_mm": 42},
}
```

When the target actually requires a revision, `write_intent(..., revision=...)`
accepts a parent file binding and reason:

```python
from hashlib import sha256
from pathlib import Path

parent = Path("enclosure_intent.json").resolve()
revision = {
    "parent": {"path": str(parent), "sha256": sha256(parent.read_bytes()).hexdigest()},
    "kind": "parameter-adjustment",
    "reason": "Adjust width within the previously declared range.",
}
```

`parameter-adjustment` is checked against that prior range. `target-change`
requires `evidence: {"kind": "user-request", "text": "..."}`;
`evidence-correction` requires `kind: "external-evidence"` with the observed
source. These records preserve lineage; they do not permit deleting requirements
to make a failed audit disappear. Keep measured dimensions in build evidence.

## Assembly-specific relationships

The pin rests in a blind socket and remains removable; the example provides no
anti-pullout retention. Feature `direction` follows the outward face normal
(the top socket is `+Z`), while insertion `assembly_axis` is independently `-Z`.
The cutter opens the socket on that top face. Endpoint `diameter` measurements
describe the socket and pin; the female diameter is derived from the pin and a
per-side gap. Purchased hardware would remain outside the export part dictionary,
with its required seat or keepout modeled on the receiving part.

Query the signatures needed for the next operation together:

```bash
a3d capabilities --symbol BuildSession --symbol BuildSession.add --symbol BuildSession.cut --symbol BuildSession.finish --symbol BuildSession.export
```

`plan_plates(bboxes, profile, *, spacing_mm=5, edge_margin_mm=0, max_plates=1)`
checks layout plans on the selected printer. Increasing `max_plates` permits a
multi-plate plan. `export_assembly()` allows multiple plates by default and
exports each as its own `name-plate-NN.stl` and `name-plate-NN.3mf`; single-plate
exports retain `name.stl` and `name.3mf`. Set `max_plates=1` only when one plate
is an explicit requirement. Report the plan and outstanding export work
accurately rather than changing the printer to suppress a packing failure.
