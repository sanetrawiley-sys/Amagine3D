# Multipart connections and serviceable enclosures

Choose a connection from the required assembly behavior. Use `a3d guide multipart`
for the complete connection registry and clearance semantics. The serviceable
enclosure guidance later in this reference applies to direct fastening into
printed plastic.

## Surface contact and insertion are different capabilities

`glue-face` represents surface contact between two physical solid/separate
features. It checks declared geometry and assembly proximity. It does not
require a cutter endpoint, insertion depth, or derived clearance. Omit
`engagement_mm` and omit or leave empty `clearances_mm` in its intent interface;
do not invent a positive engagement just to satisfy a field:

```python
contact_target = {
    "id": "bond", "connection": "glue-face", "assembly_axis": "+Z",
    "features": ["cap-face", "base-face"],
    "acceptance": "The two declared mating surfaces are in contact.",
}
```

`write_intent()` derives `between` from those features' declared owners. In the
build source, independently define both contacting members. Different contact
sizes are supported:

```python
from authoring import paired_interface, paired_dimensions

bond = paired_interface(
    id="bond", kind="glue-face",
    male_feature="cap-face", male_dimensions_mm={"width": 8, "depth": 6},
    female_feature="base-face", female_dimensions_mm={"width": 10, "depth": 8},
    clearances_mm={},
)
dimensions = paired_dimensions(bond)
```

For surface contact, omitting `female_dimensions_mm` selects the same profile
dimensions as the male member. Use the returned dimensions to build those
profiles; this convenience is not a geometric measurement or a clearance proof.
The final audit independently measures both features and verifies contact.
Geometry checks do not establish adhesive strength, joint loading, or a
removable closure.

For insertion capabilities such as `pin-socket`, female dimensions must still
come from the male dimensions and named `clearances_mm`; an independently
supplied `female_dimensions_mm` is rejected. Use `paired_dimensions()` for the
actual geometry as well as the scene interface. Endpoints are explicit
`male.featureId` and `female.featureId` fields; rearranging a `features` list
does not assign these roles. Invalid endpoints are reported together with
their field paths, actual values, and expected features.

Use `BrepFeature(id, part, role, shape)` when applying and binding a connector
feature. `cut_from()` and `bind()` retain its identity across checked booleans,
observations, and scene nodes. The single-identity example and `write_intent`
revision rules are in `authoring-example.md`. A connector change is a design
decision: preserve the existing target for routine fixes, and use a bound parent
revision with the appropriate evidence for a changed requirement.

## Positive default for serviceable enclosures

Choose this default from assembly behavior rather than a fixed list of
component names. Apply it when an installed item must enter an enclosed volume
or remain accessible for assembly or service, ordinary driver access and
purchased hardware are acceptable, and the user has not selected another
closure. If an item only passes through or follows a surface, use the necessary
opening, slot, channel, or local retention instead of creating a removable
enclosure merely because an installed item exists.

For a serviceable enclosure, start with this construction:

1. Add one locating interface, normally `collar_socket()` around the seam or
   two well-spaced `pin_socket()` pairs. The locator controls position and
   resists shear.
2. Add a symmetric pattern of appropriately sized plastic
   thread-forming/self-tapping screw connections with
   `self_tapping_screw_pair()`. Choose the screw family and count from the
   available boss volume, seam span, material, and expected service load. The
   screws clamp the seam; they do not replace the locator.
3. Put a clearance hole in the removable part and a blind pilot hole inside a
   printable boss on the receiving part. Put screw access on a reachable face.
4. For a long or flexible perimeter, add fasteners around the seam as needed
   while keeping every axis clear of ports, screen keepouts, thin walls, and
   internal components.

## M3 printable starting geometry example

Use these as configurable starting dimensions for a common 3.0 mm plastic
thread-forming/self-tapping screw with a 0.4 mm FDM process:

| Parameter | Starting value |
|---|---:|
| nominal screw diameter | 3.0 mm |
| removable-part clearance hole | 3.4 mm |
| receiving pilot hole | 2.6 mm |
| receiver boss outside diameter | 7.5 mm |
| thread engagement | 6.0 mm |
| pilot tip clearance | 0.8 mm |
| closed material beyond pilot | 1.2 mm |
| minimum radial boss wall | 1.8 mm |

These values are not universal tolerances. EJOT's thermoplastic guidance puts a
typical pilot near 0.8 times nominal diameter and allows an increase toward
0.88 for stronger or filled materials; TR Fastenings gives 2.4 mm as its ABS
example for a 3.0 mm plastics screw. The 2.6 mm CAD default is therefore a
conservative upper-end FDM starting point, not a substitute for a small hole
coupon when screw family, printer, or process changes. See the
[EJOT DELTA PT design guidance](https://www.ejot.com/medias/sys_master/Industry_Flyer/Industry_Flyer/h11/hc7/9331662782494/EJOT-DELTA-PT-Flyer-08.23-en.pdf)
and [TR Plas-Tech 30 installation guide](https://www.trfastenings.com/Knowledge-Base/Fasteners-for-Plastic/Plas-Tech-30-installation-guide).

Prefer a screw designed for direct fastening into thermoplastic. Record the
actual chosen screw family and adjust the pilot from its supplier guidance.
The recipe's minimum and maximum under-head lengths coincide at cover thickness
minus head-recess depth plus engagement. This preserves the reserved tip gap;
the gap is not extra screw length. For a different available screw length,
explicitly redesign the connection and recheck it against the requirements.
Purchased screws may appear as `display-only` assembly references, but exclude
them from STEP/STL/3MF printed-part counts and manufacturing booleans.

## One datum per screw

Every screw location owns one stable fastener ID, one origin, and one unit
direction. In the JSON scene this is `fasteners[].id` plus `axis`; `axis_id` is
only the Python helper parameter that receives the same ID. Never enter the
cover-hole center and pilot-hole center separately.

```python
from build123d import Pos, Rot
from interface_recipes import self_tapping_screw_pair

left = self_tapping_screw_pair(
    interface_id="housing-base-service-joint",
    axis_id="side-left",
    cover_thickness_mm=2.4,
    screw_family="M3 plastic thread-forming/self-tapping",
    nominal_diameter_mm=3.0,
    clearance_diameter_mm=3.4,
    pilot_diameter_mm=2.6,
    boss_outer_diameter_mm=7.5,
    engagement_mm=6.0,
    pilot_tip_clearance_mm=0.8,
    closed_end_mm=1.2,
    minimum_boss_wall_mm=1.8,
    minimum_root_embed_mm=0.4,
    cutter_overshoot_mm=1.0,
)

# Apply the SAME rigid placement to the whole group.
LEFT = Pos(-24, 0, 4) * Rot(X=-90)  # local +Z screw axis becomes object +Y
base = checked_cut(base, LEFT * left.clearance_cutter, "base-clearance-left")
housing = housing + LEFT * left.receiver_boss
housing = checked_cut(housing, LEFT * left.pilot_cutter, "housing-pilot-left")
```

Generate a symmetric partner from a mirrored datum/pattern and apply that
partner transform to its full group. Never mirror only one cutter or hand-copy
signed coordinates.

The pair uses a local `+Z` screw axis with the mating plane at `Z=0`: the cover
is on negative Z and the receiver grows toward positive Z. Rigidly rotate the
full group for side-access or bottom-access screws. The helper returns no screw
solid; its hardware record is explicitly non-manufactured.

In a semantic-scene fastener record, `receiver.minimumRootEmbedMm` is the
minimum positive-Z depth over which the compiled receiver must contain the boss
wall and fuse it into the receiver body. The boss never protrudes across the
mating plane into the negative-Z cover volume. `rootOverlapMm` is not a valid
field.

## Intent and scene records

Declare the assembly target as `connection: "self-tapping-screw"`. Its
`fastening` block ties the locator and every clearance/pilot/boss feature to the
interface:

```json
{
  "id": "housing-base-service-joint",
  "between": ["housing", "base"],
  "connection": "self-tapping-screw",
  "assembly_axis": "+Z",
  "engagement_mm": 6.0,
  "features": [
    "base-collar", "housing-socket",
    "base-clearance-left", "housing-pilot-left", "housing-boss-left",
    "base-clearance-right", "housing-pilot-right", "housing-boss-right"
  ],
  "fastening": {
    "screw_family": "M3 plastic thread-forming/self-tapping",
    "nominal_diameter_mm": 3.0,
    "pilot_diameter_mm": 2.6,
    "clearance_diameter_mm": 3.4,
    "boss_outer_diameter_mm": 7.5,
    "closed_end_mm": 1.2,
    "cutter_overshoot_mm": 1.0,
    "cover_thickness_mm": 2.4,
    "pilot_tip_clearance_mm": 0.8,
    "minimum_boss_wall_mm": 1.8,
    "minimum_root_embed_mm": 0.4,
    "locator_pairs": [
      {
        "id": "housing-base-locator",
        "male_feature": "base-collar",
        "female_feature": "housing-socket"
      }
    ],
    "fasteners": [
      {
        "id": "side-left",
        "clearance_feature": "base-clearance-left",
        "pilot_feature": "housing-pilot-left",
        "boss_feature": "housing-boss-left"
      },
      {
        "id": "side-right",
        "clearance_feature": "base-clearance-right",
        "pilot_feature": "housing-pilot-right",
        "boss_feature": "housing-boss-right"
      }
    ]
  },
  "acceptance": "the locator positions the seam and two coaxial M3 screw pairs clamp it"
}
```

In the mutable semantic scene, model every locator as its own `collar-socket` or
`pin-socket` interface with the existing `male`/`female` derived-dimension pair.
The self-tapping joint names one or more of those interfaces through
`locatorInterfaceIds`; this supports either one perimeter collar or multiple
well-spaced pin/socket pairs without flattening their pairing. Add one
`fasteners[]` item per screw. That item owns the only `axis.originMm` and
`axis.direction`; every consumed screw, cutter, cover, pilot, boss-wall, and
root-embed dimension must exactly mirror the immutable `fastening` target.
Its cover cutter, receiver pilot, and receiver boss nodes use
`recipe.kind: "selfTappingScrewPair"` and select the `clearance-cutter`,
`pilot-cutter`, or `receiver-boss` output of that same
`interfaceId`/`fastenerId` instance. Those nodes may not load independent source
meshes or declare their own transforms. Construct the three build123d outputs
from the shared recipe controls and apply one rigid placement to the entire
group, so matching labels cannot conceal misaligned geometry. Scene validation
also cross-checks locator pair IDs and ordered male/female features, fastener
IDs, mapped feature IDs, screw family, and every geometry-controlling dimension
against the immutable intent. A scene-only cutter overshoot, cover thickness,
tip clearance, boss-wall minimum, or root-embed minimum is invalid.

## Acceptance evidence

Before delivery, prove all of the following:

- every printed part participates in a declared interface unless its adhesive
  or loose installation is explicit;
- each screw pair satisfies `pilot < nominal < clearance`;
- the boss is fused to its receiving part, retains the planned radial wall,
  and leaves a blind closed end beyond the pilot;
- the clearance and pilot cuts both remove material and remain reachable by the
  chosen driver direction;
- every clearance/pilot/boss node selects one output of the same procedural
  recipe instance, and the scene axis is a unit vector;
- repeated fasteners come from one symmetric pattern, and no hole or boss
  feature is reused across two axes; and
- the locating interface fits independently of the screws.

Require the shared interface-geometry
proof to pass. Hash-bound feature/event evidence must show that the clearance
cutter, pilot cutter, and receiver boss volumes were generated from the exact
scene controls, including cover thickness and cutter overshoot. The compiler
also probes the final cover/receiver meshes with physical witness volumes. A
full clearance-cylinder witness and pilot-cylinder witness must have zero
material overlap; annular witnesses prove the minimum boss wall and, only when
a head recess target is declared, its minimum residual floor; and a solid
cylinder proves the blind end. This catches a blocked hole even when a small
center pinhole makes its axis look open. Every part must remain one fused body.
A failed recipe or physical probe is a build failure, and manufacturing
artifacts are written only after the probes pass.
